- Watch Video - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Cu3D6CQ85T4)

## 1. Binaries
- Visit [binaries](https://github.com/hemilabs/heminetwork/releases)
- Download (heminetwork_v0.4.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz) file
- Use Termius and copy the file to your VPS

- Now Follow commands
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
```bash
screen -r hemi
```
- Use CTRL C to exit the node if running and go to hemi-miner directory using cd ..
```bash
tar xvf heminetwork_v0.4.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
```bash
cd heminetwork_v0.4.5_linux_amd64
```

## 2. Verify Configuration Success
- To ensure you downloaded the correct binaries and are able to run them, execute the command below:
```bash
./popmd --help
```
- This will display the help menu for popmd, indicating that it's installed and operational.

## 3. Verify your credentials
```bash
cat ~/popm-address.json
```

## 4. Set Variables
- In your console, execute the following commands while:
1. replacing <private_key> with the value found in the JSON from Step 5
2. replacing <fee_per_vB_integer> with the fee in sat/vB you want to pay (Normally 50)

```bash
export POPM_BTC_PRIVKEY=<private_key>
export POPM_STATIC_FEE=<fee_per_vB_integer>
export POPM_BFG_URL=wss://testnet.rpc.hemi.network/v1/ws/public
```
3. Check Current Fee Levels: Visit - [Mempool](https://mempool.space/testnet)
4. Look at the "sat/vB" numbers for the different transaction fee priorities. It is recommended to set the value to the "High Priority" value or slightly higher.
5. Re-run the command to set the POPM_STATIC_FEE environment variable from above each time you want to change the fee, and restart the PoP Miner afterwards.

## 6. Run the Miner
```bash
./popmd
```

## 7. Screen settings
- Once running use: CTRL A D (to detach from screen)
- To Check the screen again use :
```bash
screen -r hemi
```

- Check Status - https://testnet.popstats.hemi.network/
